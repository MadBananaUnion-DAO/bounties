Problem Description
Project Title: Internet Creator Data Scraper - Database Seeding with Deduplication

Project Objective:
Develop a robust web scraping tool to systematically collect, deduplicate, 
and populate a database with detailed information on 100,000+ internet creators from various online platforms. This database will serve as a valuable resource for research, analysis, and business insights while ensuring that each creator is represented by a single entry, regardless of the number of websites they are found on.

Public APIs + Scraping can be used in union to create the best result. 
The 'how' is not prescriptive as long as the output meets the project requirements.

	Project Description:
The Internet Creator Data Scraper - 
Database Seeding project extends the functionality of the web scraping tool 
to not only collect data on internet creators but also to efficiently 
store this data in a structured database format. The primary goal is to accumulate 
a substantial dataset with information on a diverse range of creators while avoiding duplicate entries.

Key Features (in addition to those mentioned previously):

Database Integration: Implement database connectivity and schema for storing creator data securely. Include a unique identifier as the primary key to enforce data uniqueness.

Data Deduplication: Develop a robust deduplication mechanism to prevent the creation of multiple database entries for the same creator across various websites.

Batch Processing: Develop batch processing capabilities to handle the large volume of data efficiently, considering factors like data deduplication and performance optimization.

Incremental Updates: Enable the tool to perform incremental updates to the database, ensuring that new data is added while maintaining existing records.



	Project Scope:
Platform Compatibility: 
The scraper will be capable of extracting data from a wide range of platforms, 
including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, 
Twitter/X, Facebook, Patreon, personal websites, and blogs.

Data Points: 
The scraper will collect essential data points about creators, 
such as username/handle, follower/subscriber count, content types 
(videos, images, articles), and demographic information if available (age, location, etc.).

Scalability: 
The tool should be designed to handle large-scale 
scraping tasks efficiently, considering factors like rate 
limiting and proxy rotation to prevent IP blocking.

Scheduled Scraping: 
Enable users to schedule automated scraping tasks for 
regular updates on their chosen creator datasets.



Design and implement a database schema that can accommodate a significant volume of creator data 
while enforcing data uniqueness through deduplication.

Develop an automated process to transform scraped data 
into the appropriate format for database insertion.

Database Structure :
Define the database schema, including tables and fields, 
to store creator data, ensuring that each entry is uniquely identified to prevent duplicates.

Database should include a primary table of creators
 with name, display name, creator type, profile picture URL, country code, created/updated timestamps.

Database should include a secondary table with the 
social profiles for a given creator including the social network the profile belongs to, 
the URL to the social profile, the social profile handle, the number of followers, 
and if the profile is verified on the platform.

Acceptance Criteria
Successful extraction and insertion of data for 100,000+
creators into the database with data deduplication in place.

Minimal disruptions during database population due to efficient data processing.

By incorporating data deduplication, this project ensures that the database remains clean and consistent, 
with each unique creator represented by a single entry, 
regardless of the number of websites they are found on. 
This approach enhances the reliability and efficiency of the database seeding process.

Ability to re-run the scraper on a recurring cadence to pull additional creators for various sources.

End goal is a database of most of the content creators on the internet with their social profiles 
and basic details. I should be able to search for a creator that 
I follow and have it return a result in the DB. Non-US creators are fine to include, 
but the focus should be on North America.

Final test will be selecting several friends to list their top 10 favorite creators. 
We will take the list and search for the creators in the database. 
Passing grade will be 75% of the creators being present.
